CLASS_StepDR: CLASS with "Stepped Dark Radiation" {#mainpage}
==============================================

Author: Zilu Zhou

Description
--------------
Adapted from the CLASS (Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System) code developed by Julien Lesgourgues, Thomas Tram, Nils Schoeneberg and collaborators.

On top of full base CLASS species and utilities (as of interacting dark matter commit on 03/29/2022), this modified version of CLASS contains a new interacting dark radiation specie that contains a "step" in the history of its perturbation growth.


Using the code
--------------

You can use CLASS freely, provided that in your publications, you cite
at least the paper `CLASS II: Approximation schemes <http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2933>`. Feel free to cite more CLASS papers!
